  @title ERC20GuildUpgradeable
  @author github:AugustoL
  @dev Extends an ERC20 functionality into a Guild, adding a simple governance system over an ERC20 token.
  An ERC20Guild is a simple organization that execute arbitrary calls if a minimum amount of votes is reached in a 
  proposal action while the proposal is active.
  The token used for voting needs to be locked for a minimum period of time in order to be used as voting power.
  Every time tokens are locked the timestamp of the lock is updated and increased the lock time seconds.
  Once the lock time passed the voter can withdraw his tokens.
  Each proposal has actions, the voter can vote only once per proposal and cant change the chosen action, only
  increase the voting power of his vote.
  A proposal ends when the minimum amount of total voting power is reached on a proposal action before the proposal
  finish.
  When a proposal ends successfully it executes the calls of the winning action.
  The winning action has a certain amount of time to be executed successfully if that time passes and the action didn't
  executed successfully, it is marked as failed.
  The guild can execute only allowed functions, if a function is not allowed it will need to set the allowance for it.
  The allowed functions have a timestamp that marks from what time the function can be executed.
  A limit to a maximum amount of active proposals can be set, an active proposal is a proposal that is in Active state.
  Gas can be refunded to the account executing the vote, for this to happen the voteGas and maxGasPrice values need to
  be set.
  Signed votes can be executed in behalf of other users, to sign a vote the voter needs to hash it with the function
  hashVote, after signing the hash teh voter can share it to other account to be executed.
  Multiple votes and signed votes can be executed in one transaction.
