/**
 * @title GlobalPermissionRegistry.
 * @dev A registry of smart contracts functions and ERC20 transfers that are allowed to be called between contracts.
 * A time delay in seconds over the permissions can be set form any contract, this delay would be added to any new
 * permissions sent by that address.
 * The registry allows setting "wildcard" permissions for recipients and functions, this means that permissions like
 * this contract can call any contract, this contract can call this function to any contract or this contract call
 * call any function in this contract can be set.
 * The smart contracts permissions are stored  using the asset 0x0 and stores the `from` address, `to` address,
 *   `value` uint256 and `fromTime` uint256, if `fromTime` is zero it means the function is not allowed.
 * The ERC20 transfer permissions are stored using the asset of the ERC20 and stores the `from` address, `to` address,
 *   `value` uint256 and `fromTime` uint256, if `fromTime` is zero it means the function is not allowed.
 * The registry also allows the contracts to keep track on how much value was transferred for every asset in the actual
 * block, it adds the value transferred in all permissions used, this means that if a wildcard value limit is set and
 * a function limit is set it will add the value transferred in both of them.
